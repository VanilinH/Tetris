Endless tetris in console


there is 3 files:
Main - main part of gaming
Board - just functions for creating board in your console and freeze, clearlines mechanic
Tetromino - contain two-dimensional array(matrix), position control, movement, rotating

To run tetris in console u just need all of em in ur IDE project w folder named same as I used in "package" or just remove this part of code from every file
